# Ride Sharing App Demand Analysis

This project is made for my Human Computer Interaction class.
We created the administrator part of the ride sharing app, where
user can see statistics data and demand analysis of the business.
I used Google Maps API to display the demand dots on the map,
then modify the color and radius as required. Worked with six other
programmers and system designers.
